# Restaurant Reviews App - Stage 1

Author: Jina Chan

Created for: Udacity Front-End Nanodegree (FEND) 2018

## Description

I incrementally converted a static webpage to a mobile-ready web application. Beginning with a static design that lacked accessibility, I made the design responsive on different sized displays and accessible for screen reader use. I also added a service worker to do caching.

The code now has the following:

* Appropriate document type declaration and viewport tags
* Responsive grid-based layout using CSS
* Responsive images that adjust for the dimensions and resolution of any mobile device
* Accessibility features in the HTML
* A ServiceWorker script to cache requests to all of the siteâ€™s assets so that any page that has been visited by a user will be accessible when the user is offline.

## Installation

1. Download all files.
1. In the folder, start a simple HTTP server. If you have Python 2.x, spin up the server with `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000` (or some other port, if port 8000 is already in use.) For Python 3.x, you can use `python3 -m http.server 8000`.
2. With your server running, visit the site: `http://localhost:8000`
